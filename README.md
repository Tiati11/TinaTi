# Make a Mobile App with a Backend in React Native and Express
This repository contains the starter and end result code for App Dev Club's workshop at Technica 2022.

## Development setup
1. Download or clone this repo to your computer.
2. `cd` to the root of this repo (you should see this `README.md` when you `ls` or `dir` in this folder).
3. Follow the relevant instructions below:
    * **macOS / Linux:** run `./setup.sh` in bash, zsh, etc...
    * **Windows only:** run `./setup` in PowerShell
    * Follow the directions listed. If you get a message that says "Happy Hacking," then you are all set.

## Running
This is a two part app, it has a frontend and a backend. As such there are two parts to running this app, for which you will need two terminal windows.

1. Switch into the `app` directory, run `npm start`. The Expo server should be running.
2. Switch into the `backend` directory, run `npm start`. This should start the API server, presuming there are no syntax errors.

## Viewing the finished code
If you downloaded from GitHub, you can just change your branch in the website. If you cloned, you can simply `git checkout finished-code`. (You might also have to rerun the above commands to ensure the dependencies are installed still.)
